# Computer-graphic-Animated-Scene
Create an animated scene using OpenGL. This project was completed in December 2024.

This project is inspired by the movie "Silence Hill".

In daylight, everything looks good. A big board is hanging up there showing the location, and there were guards moving around. This mysterious small town has maze-like paths.

Everything changed at night. The flowers, grass and trees around were stained with blood. Pyramid Head and the nurse in Silent Hill both appeared. They were surrounded outside the maze with weapons, waiting for the next person who could be killed to show up.

We must overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles along the way to go back to the earth. In the game, it's shown by a self-roatating earth.
